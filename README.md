# nautilus_scripts
Scripts to be called from Nautilus

* `convert_to_mp3`: converts the selected files to mp3. Since I have a watcher on mp3 files to sync a database of mine, 
I specified to store the temporary results in a temp file and renaming it when the process is done (removing also the original file).
